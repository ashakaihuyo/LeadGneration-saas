"""
Discovery Service.

Orchestrates the full, deterministic discovery pipeline:

    parse -> search (Overpass, general web-search fallback if that finds
    nothing) -> resolve+validate website (Overpass website, else Serper
    fallback) -> duplicate detection -> ranking -> Lead creation ->
    existing LeadPipeline.execute()

This is the *only* module that talks to the database and to
application.workflows.lead_pipeline -- every other discovery module
(query_parser, providers, business_normalizer, website_resolver,
website_validator, duplicate_detector, ranking) is a pure/self-contained
building block with no knowledge of Lead, LeadPipeline, or the DB.

No LLM call happens anywhere in this file or anything it calls before a
Lead is hantded to LeadPipeline.execute() -- from that point on, the
existing, unmodified pipeline (and its own AI-feature gating) takes over
exactly as it does for manually-created leads.

The default website-resolution fallback provider is SerperWebsiteResolver
(application.discovery.providers.serper_provider) -- Brave's API now
requires a card on file, whereas Serper offers a free tier with no card
required. BraveWebsiteResolver is untouched and still fully usable by
constructor-injecting it as `resolver_fallback` if you have a Brave key.
Nothing else about provider selection changed: this remains the only
dependency-injection point, exactly as before.

Business-search fallback: Overpass (OpenStreetMap) only knows about
businesses that are physically map-able -- it returns zero results just
as often for a real category with no OSM presence (SaaS companies,
remote-first agencies, freelancers, ...) as for a genuine dead end. Rather
than special-casing a fixed list of categories that "look like" they need
a fallback (which would only ever cover categories someone thought to
enumerate, and wouldn't generalize to whatever a person actually types),
`_search` falls back to `business_search_fallback`
(SerperBusinessSearchProvider by default) for ANY category whenever the
primary provider comes back with zero candidates. Overpass is always
tried first and never skipped -- the fallback only ever runs after it has
already returned nothing.
