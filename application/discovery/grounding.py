Grounding utilities.

Shared, deterministic checks used by both Serper's candidate-selection
scoring (providers/serper_provider.py) and the final business ranking
(ranking.py) to answer one question in two different contexts: "does this
website/domain plausibly belong to *this actual* business, in *this
actual* location" -- as opposed to a same-named-but-different business, a
generic directory, or an unrelated global brand that happens to share a
common word.

Consolidated here, rather than duplicated per-caller, specifically because
grounding quality was the highest-priority problem: naive substring
matching previously let a Mumbai shoe store named "Regal" match an
unrelated US cinema chain's domain (because the word "regal" appeared in
the result's title), and let "Hollywood Walk of Shame" match
walkoffame.com (because "walk" is a substring of "walkoffame"). Both are
now rejected by the stricter checks below.
