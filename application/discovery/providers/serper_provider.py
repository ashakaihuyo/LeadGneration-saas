"""
Serper Provider (fallback website resolution ONLY).

Drop-in replacement for BraveWebsiteResolver as DiscoveryService's default
fallback WebsiteResolverProvider -- same interface, same role in the
pipeline (only ever called when Overpass has no website, or its website
failed validation), same "never fabricate, never scrape results" rules.
Brave requires a card on file to obtain a key; Serper offers a free tier
(2500 credits) with no card required, which is the only reason for the
switch.

Used exclusively when a business from the primary search provider has no
website, an invalid website, or an unreachable website.

If SERPER_API_KEY is not configured, this provider is inert: it logs once
and returns None for every call -- byte-for-byte the same
"fail gracefully, never crash Discovery" behavior BraveWebsiteResolver
already had.

Grounding
---------
Result scoring is built on application.discovery.grounding, not naive
substring matching. Naive matching (checking whether any word of the
business name appears anywhere inside the domain, or vice versa) is what
previously let a Mumbai shoe store named "Regal" resolve to
regmovies.com (an unrelated US cinema chain -- "regal" doesn't even
appear as a substring of "regmovies", it was the generic "https + root
path" quality score alone that cleared the old, too-low acceptance bar)
and let "Hollywood Walk of Shame" resolve to walkoffame.com. Two changes
fix this:

  1. Brand relevance is now a *gate*, not just an additive bonus: a result
     is only scored at all if grounding.brand_match_strength finds a real
     brand/domain relationship, or the business name literally appears in
     the result title. Generic page-quality signals (https, root domain)
     are no longer, by themselves, enough to pass.
  2. A generic/low-signal business name (grounding.is_low_signal_business_name
     -- e.g. a name pattern like "<Person> Hospital" that repeats near-
     identically across many cities) additionally requires the location to
     be corroborated somewhere in the result (title/snippet/URL) before
     being trusted -- brand match alone can't tell "this city's branch"
     apart from a same-named business elsewhere.
