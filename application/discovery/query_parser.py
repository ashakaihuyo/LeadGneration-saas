"""
Query Parser.

Deterministic parsing of a natural-language business search into
(category, location, limit, modifier). Pure regex + a small fixed
location dictionary (application.discovery.locations) -- no LLM, no
spaCy/NER model, no external calls, fully unit-testable.

Handles, in order of how the parse is attempted:

  1. Filler-phrase stripping: leading conversational filler ("I need",
     "Looking for", "Find", "Show me", ...) is removed before pattern
     matching, so "Need software companies near Bangalore" is parsed the
     same as "software companies near Bangalore".

  2. Preposition-based patterns (as before, but with a wider set of
     recognized prepositions): "in", "near", "around", "close to",
     "located in", "situated in" -- optionally prefixed with a leading
     count. The count can be spelled as "top <N>", "best <N>", or just a
     bare "<N>" -- "top"/"best" are informational synonyms, not required.
        "Top shoe stores in Mumbai"
        "Top 20 coffee shops around Pune"
        "Find me the best 10 gyms in Delhi"
        "Need law firms located in Chennai"
        "Restaurants close to Mumbai Airport"

  3. No-preposition, gazetteer-assisted split: when neither a filler
     phrase nor a recognized preposition is present, the query is split
     on a known city name (application.discovery.locations.KNOWN_LOCATIONS)
     found as a trailing or leading phrase.
        "Software companies Noida"      -> category="Software companies", location="Noida"
        "Noida software companies"      -> category="software companies", location="Noida"
        "Dental clinics Bangalore"
        "Real estate agents Kolkata"

  4. Placeholder-location rejection: a location that resolves to a
     non-place placeholder ("me", "here", "nearby", "my area", ...) is
     rejected with a clear QueryParseError rather than silently searched
     for -- Overpass/the fallback providers have no way to geocode "me",
     so accepting it would either return nothing or (worse) something
     ungrounded. The person is asked for an actual city/area name instead.

This is a deliberately small, fixed set of patterns/dictionary lookups --
not a general-purpose NLP parser -- so it stays fast, dependency-free, and
easy to reason about.
