"""
Evaluation utilities.

Deterministic (non-LLM) checks that score an agent's output on four axes:
  - confidence:    the agent's own self-reported confidence
  - completeness:  fraction of expected fields that were actually populated
  - grounding:     fraction of cited evidence strings that actually appear
                    in the source text the agent was given (a simple but
                    effective hallucination check)
  - consistency:   whether the decision aligns with the deterministic score
                    that fed into it

Kept deterministic and cheap on purpose: this is the "Confidence
Evaluation" workflow stage, and per the spec agents should never call the
LLM more than necessary -- evaluation should not cost a second LLM call
just to check the first one.
